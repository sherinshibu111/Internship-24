# Homophily-driven community detection on attributed networks
Problem Addressed

Based on the homophilia principle, which states that people associate with people who share the same characteristics, homophily-driven community detection is a method of detection.  A new approach based on a homophily concept to identify communities in connected networks, where the nodes with similar characteristics tend to be more closely correlated, has been proposed in this paper. In this way, we are trying to bridge the gap from network topology to attribute information using topological or homomorphic properties.

Homophily, the tendency of similar nodes to be grouped together plays a crucial role in community detection.  This is particularly useful in attribute networks, where attributes such as personal interest, demographics, and behavior are present on the nodes. In order to detect communities in distributed networks, machine learning techniques have been widely applied, resulting in promising results in detecting structural and attribute-based homophily.

Literature Review

A subfield of data mining and social network research known as homophily-driven community detection focuses on finding communities in networks where nodes are connected by similar features. This contrasts with traditional community detection methods that only consider the topology of the network. Some of the applications include fraud detection, recommendation systems, and social network analysis. Methods for homophily-driven community detection can be classified into attribute-based and structural categories. High dimensionality, noise, and a deficiency of labeled data are challenges. Promising solutions have been found recently; noise reduction, large-scale network construction, and performance evaluation should be the main focus of future study.  Homophily-driven community detection is a field that has a high potential. As data availability on attributed networks increases, further advancements are expected.
